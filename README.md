# Machine-Learning-JS
Machine Learning algorithms experiments using Node.js as server, client-side JavaScript operations and and MongoDB as data source.

../data/ folder contains the example database.

### Implemented algorithms
* Simple C4.5
* Simple PRISM
* Cross Validation

### To do (at least)
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic algorithm
* k-means
